* **Simple**:Java is easy to learn and its syntax is quite simple, clean and easy to understand
* **Object Oriented**: Following are some basic concept of OOP's.Object,Class,Inheritance,Polymorphism,Abstraction,Encapsulation
* **Robust**: Java makes an effort to eliminate error prone codes by emphasizing mainly on compile time error checking and runtime checking
* **High Performance-Interpreted language**: It is an interpreted language, i.e. there is no need for compilation.
* **Platform Independent**: Java code will be run on every platform, Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, Windows.
